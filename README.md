# Open Insights

Welcome to Open Insights â€“ the open-source solution for fault detection and diagnostics in building automation systems. Leveraging the power of IoT data and advanced analytics, Open Insights offers a comprehensive toolkit for importing messy data, creating clean Brick schema graph models, and developing a robust fault detection rules library. Dive into predictive modeling and simulations to streamline building operations and maintenance.

## Features

- [ ] **Data Importation**: Simplify the ingestion of diverse IoT and BACnet data into a usable format.
- [ ] **Brick Schema Modeling**: Utilize our tools to convert raw data into a Brick-compliant graph model for enhanced interoperability.
- [ ] **Fault Detection Library**: Access and contribute to an open-source repository of fault detection rules.
- [ ] **Automated Fault Detection**: Set up automatic, interval-based scans to detect and log faults, ensuring consistent system checks and maintenance alerts.
- [ ] **Predictive Analytics**: Implement machine learning models to predict and simulate building system behaviors.
