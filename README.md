## What is Open Operator?

Open Operator is an open source AI Assitant that specialized in building operations and maintenance. It has access to all the tools it needs to help the building run efficently.

## Problem

Today in building operations information sits in different data siloes which makes it hard to get a good idea about how the building is operating. For example, most of the asset information is stuck inside hard copy building documents that managers need to manually search through. A lot of the work for this project involves extracting information from these different data siloes and aligning the systems.

## Features

- [ ] **Data Importation**: Simplify the ingestion of information
- [ ] **Brick Schema Modeling**: Utilize our tools to convert raw data into a Brick-compliant graph model for enhanced interoperability.
- [ ] **Fault Detection Rules Library**: Access and contribute to an open-source repository of fault detection rules.
- [ ] **Automated Fault Detection**: Set up automatic, interval-based scans to detect and log faults, ensuring consistent system checks and maintenance alerts.
- [ ] **Predictive Analytics**: Implement machine learning models to predict and simulate building system behaviors.
