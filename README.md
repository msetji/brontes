## What is Open Operator?

Open Operator is an open source AI Assitant that specialized in building operations and maintenance. It has access to all the tools it needs to help facility owners, managers, and operators run their buildings more efficetly.

Today in building operations information sits in different data siloes which makes it hard to access information or get a good idea about how the building is operating quickly. For example, asset information is stuck inside hard copy building documents that managers need to manually search through, while work orders are in a CMMS system, and building performance data is inside a BAS.

A lot of the work for this project involves extracting information from these different data siloes and aligning the systems.

## Tools

1. Building Documents: Drawings/Plans, O&M Manuals, submittals, etc.
2. Memory: History of all conversations and everything that occurred in the building
3. Real time and historical performance data of the building
4. API Integrations: Work Order System, Energy Bills
5. Domain Knowledge: Industry Standards and guidlines
6. Simulation & Prediction Models: Ability to run simulations to see how the building might react

## Get Started

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/syyclops/open-operator.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
$ cd open-operator

# Create and activate python virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
