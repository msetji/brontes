## Device

The Devices API provides a robust framework for the seamless integration and management of Controllers (also known as Devices) within a digital twin ecosystem.
These Devices are crucial assets responsible for field bus Input/Output (I/O) operations across a variety of protocols, including BACnet, Modbus, and OPC.
By facilitating direct communication with equipment, sensors, and actuators, each Device plays a pivotal role in the real-time monitoring and control of physical systems.
